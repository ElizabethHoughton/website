We\nwill also use ggplot2 and dplyr for plotting\nand cleaning.\n\n\n\nLoad Data\nThese data are from the Turkey Lakes watershed experiment. This dataset\ncontains the abundances of benthic invertebrate species measured in the\nMay and June from 1995 to 2001. They recorded the type and number of\ninvertebrates in an area of the stream, with 10 replicates per sampling\nevent. These forests next to these streams were logged in 1997 with\nvarying harvest intensities, with low, medium, and high intensity\nharvest and a control stream with no forest harvest. We will using the\ncodyn package to analyze the diversity of these benthic\ninvertebrates over time.\n\n  year   species treatment replicate abundance\n1 1995 Alloperla   control         1         0\n2 1995 Alloperla   control         2         0\n3 1995 Alloperla   control         3         4\n4 1995 Alloperla   control         4         3\n5 1995 Alloperla   control         5         3\n6 1995 Alloperla   control         6         3\n\nFor many functions, the codyn package can only look at data\nfrom one stream at a time. So first we will separate each stream into\nit’s own data frame.\n\n\n\nUsing\nthe codyn package to analyze diversity data over time\nEcologists are often interested in how diversity changes over time in\none place. This is particularly interesting when you are looking at how\nspecies diversity responds to environmental change. This environmental\nchange can be a single disturbance event such as a forest fire or more\nlong-term change such as temperature increases due to climate change.\nThe Turkey Lakes dataset provides us with an opportunity to look at how\nthe diversity of benthic invertebrates changes over time and in response\nto logging. We can compare the diversity of different streams with\ndifferent logging intensities and we can also compare the diversity of\nstreams.\nThe codyn package allows us to analyze the change in\nbiodiversity over time using different metrics.\nUsing\ncommunity_structure()\ncommunity_structure() is a function in the package\ncodyn that calculates species richness and evenness.\nSpecies Richness and\nEvenness\nFor example, we can use community_structure() to look at\nthe change in species richness and evenness over time in one of the\nTurkey Lake streams. We will choose the stream with high logging\nintensity as an example. This function can only look at one stream at a\ntime so make sure to subset out the stream that you are interested\nin.\nLet’s take a look at the high intensity logging stream data.\n\n  year     species treatment replicate abundance\n1 1995 Amphinemura      high         1         9\n2 1995 Amphinemura      high         2        24\n3 1995 Amphinemura      high         3        53\n4 1995 Amphinemura      high         4        15\n5 1995 Amphinemura      high         5        59\n6 1995 Amphinemura      high         6        37\n\nAs you can see, there is a column for year, species, replicate, and\nabundance.\nThe community structure function has five arguments. The first is\ndf where you put in the data frame of interest, in our case\nsubset_codyn_high. The time.var argument is\nwhere you put in your time variable (year), the\nabundance.var argument is where you put the column that holds the\nabundance variable (abundance) and the\nreplicate.var argument holds the column with the replicates\n(replicate). In the metric argument, you can\nspecify the metric of evenness that you want the function to calculate.\nThere are three possible metrics: Evar,\nSimpsonEvenness, and EQ, which all calculate\nevenness in different ways. We will use Simpson’s Evenness in this\ntutorial. Remember, if you ever need a refresher on the syntax you can\ntype ?community_structure into the R script.\n\n\n\nWe can take a look at the output.\n\n  year replicate richness SimpsonEvenness\n1 1995         1       17       0.2210248\n2 1996         1       11       0.5785671\n3 1997         1       16       0.3436584\n4 1998         1       18       0.2786702\n5 1999         1       15       0.3540228\n6 2001         1       23       0.2661854\n\nAs you can see, this returns a data frame with the year, replicate,\nrichness calculation, and evenness measure. It calculates richness and\nevenness separately for each replicate sample in the stream, so we have\na measure of variability within samples as well as variability across\nyears.\nPlot species richness\nWe can plot this data frame to see the changes over time.\n\n\n\nHere is a plot of species richness, with a different value for each\nreplicate. The red line is the year that the streams were logged. Do you\nsee any change? Do you think there are any significant patterns? How\ndoes the variability between replicates compare to the variability\nbetween years?\nPlot species evenness\nWe can also plot species evenness over time.\n\n\n\nDo you see any patterns in the evenness between years?\nUsing\ncommunity_diversity()\nShannon’s diversity\nSpecies richness and evenness are very simple ways to look at species\ndiversity. However, as you learned from the rank abundance curves,\nspecies have different abundances within the community, with some\nspecies having very high abundance and most species having low\nabundance. Species richness does not take into account the relative\nabundances of each species, which limits the inferences we can make. The\nShannon-Weiner diversity metric does take into account these relative\nabundances when calculating the diversity of a community and allows us\nto make more meaningful inferences about how biodiversity is changing\nover time.\nThe codyn package allows you to calculate the Shannon\ndiversity index for a single site over time using the\ncommunity_diversity() function. We will again use the data\nfrom the stream with the high logging intensity. Luckily, this function\nhas the exact same syntax as the community_structure()\nfunction! The only difference is that the options for the\nmetric argument are Shannon and\nInverseSimpson. We will first use Shannon.\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the output for this function.\n\n  year replicate  Shannon\n1 1995         1 1.836002\n2 1996         1 2.044210\n3 1997         1 2.107977\n4 1998         1 2.016146\n5 1999         1 1.948510\n6 2001         1 2.297970\n\nYou can see it gives us a data frame of year,\nreplicate, and Shannon, which is our measure\nof Shannon diversity.\nPlot Shannon’s diversity\nWe can plot these to see change over time.\n\n\n\nSimpson’s diversity\nWe can also use the same function to calculate Simpson’s diversity by\nsimply changing the metric argument to\nInverseSimpson.\n\n\n\nWe can look at the output.\n\n  year replicate InverseSimpson\n1 1995         1       3.757421\n2 1996         1       6.364238\n3 1997         1       5.498534\n4 1998         1       5.016063\n5 1999         1       5.310341\n6 2001         1       6.122265\n\nPlot Simpson’s diversity\nAnd then plot.\n\n\n\nHow do these patterns compare to the patterns of Shannon’s diversity\nover time? How do the values compare?\nActivity\nCalculate richness, evenness, and diversity using both the Shannon\nand Simpson indices for the streams with low intensity logging, high\nintensity logging, and no logging. The data for these streams are\nsubset_codyn_low, subset_codyn_high, and\nsubset_codyn_ctrl. Plot these indices. Do you see any\npatterns across years? How do these compare to the patterns in the high\nintensity logging stream?\n\n\n\n",
